DriverPass was a client that offered driving classes to the public before they took their offical driving test throught the DMV. They wanted their system design to be remotely accessible, to allow clients to book classes online, see their progress and have admin be able to change the classes offered or disable classes. Through this course, I think I understoof the requirements and needs of DriverPass well. I think working on UML diagrams and imporving them is always a need. During more practice, I think I could succeeded well in this area. I interpreted the user's needs by making sure the system contained all the requested components, stayed within the budget and offered technical guidelines. It is very important to consider the user's needs while designing a system because they are paying for it and it needs to be relatable ane easy to use for their customers so they do not lose money. My approach to designing software is to first do research, gather all details, needs, wants that I can and creating a base diagram for it. Then as the system develops, the mext layer of the UML diagram can be completed and so on. Coding then can follow once all teh details are achieved. Then testing can start and debugging and reformulating as needed.
